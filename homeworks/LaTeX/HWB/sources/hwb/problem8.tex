\section{Problem (8)}
	A horizontal vinyl record of radius $0.089 \ m$ rotates freely about a vertical axis through its center with an angular speed of $4.7 \ rad/s$. The rotational inertia of the record about its axis of rotation is $3.0 \times 10^{-4} kg \times m^{2}$. A wad of wet putty of mass $24 \ g$ drops vertically onto the record from above and sticks to the edge of the record. What is the angular speed of the record immediately after the putty sticks to it?
