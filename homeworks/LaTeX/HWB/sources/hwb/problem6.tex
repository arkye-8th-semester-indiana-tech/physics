\section{Problem (6)}
	A wheel is rotating freely at angular speed $960 \ rev/min$ on a shaft whose rotational inertia is negligible. A second wheel, initially at rest and with $4.0$ times the rotational inertia of the first, is suddenly coupled to the same shaft.

	\subsection{Question (a)}

		What is the angular speed of the resultant combination of the shaft and two wheels?

		\textbf{R:}

		\begin{align}
			x
		\end{align}

	\subsection{Question (b)}

		What fraction of the original rotational kinetic energy is lost?

		\textbf{R:}

		\begin{align}
			x
		\end{align}
