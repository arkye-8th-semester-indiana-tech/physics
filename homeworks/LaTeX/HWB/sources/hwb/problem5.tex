\section{Problem (5)}
	A man stands on a platform that is rotating (without friction) with an angular speed of $0.54 \ rev/s$; his arms are outstretched and he holds a brick in each hand. The rotational inertia of the system consisting of the man, bricks, and platform about the central axis is $4.4 \ kg \times m^{2}$. If by moving the bricks the man decreases the rotational inertia of the system to $2.8 \ kg \times m^{2}$,

	\subsection{Question (a)}

		What is the resulting angular speed of the platform?

		\textbf{R:}

		\begin{align}
			x
		\end{align}

	\subsection{Question (b)}

		What is the ratio of the new kinetic energy of the system to the original kinetic energy?

		\textbf{R:}

		\begin{align}
			x
		\end{align}
