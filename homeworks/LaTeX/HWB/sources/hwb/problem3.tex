\section{Problem (3)}

	In the instant of the \cref{fig:hwb_problem3}, two particles move in an $xy$ plane. Particle $P_{1}$ has mass $1.8 \ sl$ and speed $v_{1} = \ 5.2 \ ft/s$, and it is at distance $d_{1} = \ 4.0 \ ft$ from point $O$. Particle $P_{2}$ has mass $1.2 \ sl$ and speed $v_{2} = \ 7.6 \ ft/s$, and it is at distance $d_{2} = \ 7.5 \ ft$ from point $O$. What is the net angular momentum of the two particles about $O$? Take counterclockwise as the positive direction.
