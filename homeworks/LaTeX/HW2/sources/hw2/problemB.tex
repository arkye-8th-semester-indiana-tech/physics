\section{Problem (11)}
	A proton moves along the $x$ axis according to the equation $x = 47t + 12t^{2}$, where $x$ is in meters and $t$ in seconds. Calculate:

	\subsection{Question (a)}
		The average velocity of the proton during the first $3.0 \ s$ of its motion.

		\textbf{R:} \newline

	\subsection{Question (b)}
		The instantaneous velocity of the proton at $t = 3.0 \ s$.

		\textbf{R:} \newline

	\subsection{Question (c)}
		The instantaneous acceleration of the proton at $t = 3.0 \ s$.

		\textbf{R:} \newline
