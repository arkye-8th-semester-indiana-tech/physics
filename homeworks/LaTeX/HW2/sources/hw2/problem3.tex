\section{Problem (3)}
	At a certain time a particle had a speed of $42 \ ft/s$ in the positive $x$ direction, and $5.2 \ s$ later its speed was $77 \ ft/s$ in the opposite direction. What was the average acceleration of the particle during this $5.2 \ s$ interval?

	\textbf{R:} \newline
	\begin{align}
		\bar{a} = \ &\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}& \notag \\
		\Delta v = \ &v_{f} - v_{i} = (-77 \ ft/s) - (42 \ ft/s) = - 119 \ ft/s& \notag \\
		\Delta t = \ &t_{f} - t_{i} = (5.2 \ s) - (0 \ s) = 5.2& \notag \\
		\bar{a} = \ &\frac{- 119 \ ft/s}{5.2 \ s} = -22.9 \ ft/s^{2}&
	\end{align}
