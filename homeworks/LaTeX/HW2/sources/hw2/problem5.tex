\section{Problem (5)}
	The brakes on your automobile are capable of creating a deceleration of $23 \ ft/s^{2}$. If you are going $93 \ mi/h$ and suddenly see a state trooper, what is the minimum time in which you can get your car under the $65 \ mi/h$ speed limit? (The answer reveals the futility of braking to keep your high speed from being detected with a radar or laser gun.)
