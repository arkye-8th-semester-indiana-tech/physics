\section{Problem (6)}
	During the launch from a board, a diver's angular speed about her center of mass changes from zero to $4.9 \ rad/s$ in $220 \ ms$. Her rotational inertia about her center of mass is $9.2 \ sl \times ft^{2}$. During the launch,

	\subsection{Question (a)}

		What is the magnitude of her average angular acceleration?

		\textbf{R:}

		\begin{align}
			\overline{\alpha} = \ &\frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}& \notag \\
			= \ &\frac{4.9 \ rad/s}{0.22 \ s}& \notag \\
			= \ &22.\overline{27} \ rad/s^{2}&
		\end{align}

	\subsection{Question (b)}

		What is the magnitude of the average external torque on her from the board?

		\textbf{R:}

		\begin{align}
			\tau = \ &I \alpha& \notag \\
			= \ &(9.2 \ sl \times ft^{2})\left(22.\overline{27} \ s^{-2}\right)& \notag \\
			= \ &204.\overline{90} \ lb \times ft&
		\end{align}
