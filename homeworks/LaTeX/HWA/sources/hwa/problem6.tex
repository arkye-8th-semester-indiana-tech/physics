\section{Problem (6)}
	During the launch from a board, a diver's angular speed about her center of mass changes from zero to $4.9 \ rad/s$ in $220 \ ms$. Her rotational inertia about her center of mass is $9.2 \ sl \times fr^{2}$. During the launch,

	\subsection{Question (a)}

		What is the magnitude of her average angular acceleration?

		\textbf{R:}

		\begin{align}
			x

	\subsection{Question (b)}

		What is the magnitude of the average external torque on her from the board?

		\textbf{R:}

		\begin{align}
			x
		\end{align}
