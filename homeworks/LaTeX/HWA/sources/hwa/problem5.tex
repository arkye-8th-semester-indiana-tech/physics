\section{Problem (5)}
	The body in \cref{fig:hwa_problem5} is pivoted at $O$. Three forces act on it in the directions shown: $F_{A} = \ 9.3 \ N$ at point $A$, $7.5 \ m$ from $O$; $F_{B} = \ 11.0 \ N$ at point $B$, $5.4 \ m$ from $O$; and $F_{C} = \ 8.8 \ N$ at point $C$, $4.4 \ m$ from $O$. Taking the clockwise direction to be negative, what is the net torque about $O$?
