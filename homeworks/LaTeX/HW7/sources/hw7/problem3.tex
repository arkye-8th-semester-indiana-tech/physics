\section{Problem (3)}

	The only force acting on a $2.8 \ sl$ canister that is moving in a $xy$ plane has a magnitude of $4.7 \ lb$. The canister initially has a velocity of $3.9 \ ft/s$ in the positive $x$ direction, and some time later has a velocity of $5.6 \ ft/s$ in the positive $y$ direction. How much work is done on the canister by the $4.7 \ lb$ force during this time?

	\textbf{R:}

	\begin{align}
		\left|\vec{v_{i}}\right| = \ &3.9 \ ft/s& \notag \\
		K_{i} = \ &\frac{1}{2}(2.8 \ sl)(3.9 \ ft/s)^{2}& \notag \\
		= \ &21.294 \ ft \times lb& \notag \\
		\left|\vec{v_{f}}\right| = \ &5.6 \ ft/s& \notag \\
		K_{f} = \ &\frac{1}{2}(2.8 \ sl)(5.7 \ ft/s)^{2}& \notag \\
		= \ &45.486 \ ft \times lb& \notag \\
		W_{net} = \ &K_{f} - K_{i}& \notag \\
		= \ &(45.486 \ ft \times lb) - (21.294 \ ft \times lb)& \notag \\
		= \ &24.192 \ ft \times lb&
	\end{align}
