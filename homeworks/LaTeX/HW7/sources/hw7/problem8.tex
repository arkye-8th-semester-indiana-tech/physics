\section{Problem (8)}
	The force on a particle is directed along an $x$ axis and given by $F = 4.2x - 3.1$ where $x$ is in meters and $F$ is in Newtons. Find the work done by the force in moving the particle from $x = 0$ and $x = 2.9 \ m$.

	\textbf{R:}

	\begin{align}
		W = \ &\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}} F(x) \ dx& \notag \\
		= \ &\int_{0}^{2.9 \ m} (4.2 \ N/m)x - (3.1 \ N) \ dx& \notag \\
		= \ &\left[(2.1 \ N/m)x^{2} - (3.1 \ N)x\right]_{0}^{2.9 \ m}& \notag \\
		= \ &(2.1 \ N/m)\left(2.9 \ m\right)^{2} - (3.1 \ N)(2.9 \ m)& \notag \\
		= \ &(17.661 \ J) - (8.99 \ J)& \notag \\
		= \ &8.671 \ J&
	\end{align}
