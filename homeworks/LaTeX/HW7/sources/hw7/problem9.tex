\section{Problem (9)}
	A $6.5 \ lb$ block is pulled at a constant speed of $2.4 \ ft/s$ across a horizontal floor by an applied force of $19 \ lb$ directed $14^{o}$ above the horizontal. What is the \textbf{rate} at which the force does work on the block?

	\textbf{R:}

	\begin{align}
		P = \ &\vec{F} \bullet \vec{v} = Fv \cos \theta& \notag \\
		= \ &(19 \ lb)(2.4 \ ft/s) \cos 14^{o}& \notag \\
		= \ &44.245 \ ft \times lb/s&
	\end{align}
