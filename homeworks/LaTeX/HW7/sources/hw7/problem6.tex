\section{Problem (6)}
	During spring semester at MIT, residents of the parallel buildings of the East Campus dorms battle one another with large catapults that are made with surgical hose mounted on a window frame. A balloon filled with dyed water is placed in a pouch attached to the hose, which is then stretched through the width of the room. Assume that the stretching of the hose obeys Hooke's Law with a spring constant of $38 \ lb/ft$. If the hose is stretched by $6.1 \ ft$ and then released, how much work does the force from the hose do on the balloon in the pouch by the time reaches its relaxed length?

	\textbf{R:}

	\begin{align}
		W_{s} = \ &\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}& \notag \\
		= \ &\frac{1}{2}(38 \ lb/ft)(6.1 \ ft)^{2}& \notag \\
		= \ &(19 \ lb/ft)\left(37.21 \ ft^{2}\right)& \notag \\
		= \ &669.78 \ ft \times lb&
	\end{align}
