\section{Problem (5)}
	A $5.1 \ g$ marble is fired vertically upward using a spring gun. The spring must be compressed $3.8 \ cm$ if the marble is to just reach a target $9.6 \ m$ above the marble's position on the compressed spring.

	\subsection{Question (a)}

		What is the change $\Delta U_{g}$ in the gravitational potential energy of the marble-Earth system during the $9.6 \ m$ ascent?

		\textbf{R:}

		\begin{align}
			\Delta U_{g} = \ &U_{g_{f}} - U_{g_{i}}& \notag \\
			\Delta U_{g} = \ &mgy_{f} - mg(0)& \notag \\
			\Delta U_{g} = \ &(0.0051 \ kg)\left(9.8 m/s^{2}\right)(9.6 \ m)& \notag \\
			\Delta U_{g} = \ &0.4798 \ J&
		\end{align}

	\subsection{Question (b)}

		What is the change $\Delta U_{s}$ in the elastic potential energy of the spring during its launch of the marble?

		\textbf{R:}

		\begin{align}
			\Delta U_{s} = \ &U_{s_{f}} - U_{s_{i}}& \notag \\
			\Delta U_{s} = \ &\frac{1}{2}k(0)^{2} - \frac{1}{2}kx_{i}^{2}& \notag \\
			\Delta U_{s} = \ &- \frac{1}{2}kx_{i}^{2}& \notag
		\end{align}

		Since the change in the elastic potential energy is based only on its initial condition and the change in the gravitational potential energy is based only on its final condition:

		\begin{align}
			E_{tot,f} = \ &U_{g_{f}} = E_{tot,i} = U_{s_{i}} = - \Delta U_{s}& \notag \\
			\Delta U_{s} = \ &- 0.4798 \ J&
		\end{align}

	\subsection{Question (c)}

		What is the spring constant of the spring?

		\textbf{R:}

		\begin{align}
			U_{s_{i}} = \ &\frac{1}{2}kx_{i}^{2}& \notag \\
			k = \ &2 \frac{U_{s_{i}}}{x_{i}^{2}}& \notag \\
			= \ &2 \frac{0.4798 \ J}{(0.038 \ m)^{2}}& \notag \\
			= \ &664.5429 \ N/m&
		\end{align}
