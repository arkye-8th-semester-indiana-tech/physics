\section{Collision}
	By its nature, a collision involves forces that are internal to the colliding object.

	To the extent that external forces (like friction) do zero impulse, then

	\begin{align}
		\vec{P}_{tot} = constant
	\end{align}

	Two types of collision:

	1) Elastic - Kinetic Energy is also conserved. Only can 100\% happen on a microscopic level (atoms).

	2) Inelastic - Kinetic Energy \textbf{not} conserved.

	2A) Perfectly Inelastic - Kinetic Energy loss is a maximum (objects stick together).

	In a pure collision, kinetic energy cannot increase.
