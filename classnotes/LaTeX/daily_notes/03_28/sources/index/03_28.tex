\section{Chapter 8}

Definition: Energy is the ability to do work.

Definition: Potential energy is energy that a system contains because of position.

\begin{align}
 U_g = gravitational potential energy
 U_g = mgy
 m = mass
 g = acceleration due to gravity
 y = height
\end{align}

The point where $y = 0$ may be chosen for convenience, but then can't be changed

\begin{align}
	potential energy = stored energy
\end{align}

\begin{align}
	U_s = spring potential energy
	U_s = \frac{1}{2}kx^2
	k = spring constant
	x = deflection from equilibrium
\end{align}

Definition: A force that can store energy is called a conservative ``force".

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gravity
	\item Spring
	\item Magnetic
	\item Electric
	\item Etc
\end{itemize}

Definition: A non-conservative force cannot store energy.

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Drag
	\item Friction
	\item Applied (pushes/pulls)
	\item Tension
	\item Normal
	\item Etc
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
	Conservative Force \leftrightarrow Potential Energy
\end{align}

\section{Law of Conservation of Energy}

If non-conservative forces do zero work, then

\begin{align}
	E_{total} = constant
	E_{total} = total mechanical energy
	E_{total} = K + \sum U
	= K + U_g + U_s
\end{align}

Iff
\begin{align}
	W_{nc} = 0
\end{align}

then
\begin{align}
	E_{total} = constant
\end{align}
